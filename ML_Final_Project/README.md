This project explores the feasability of using an ensemble of boosted regression trees to predict the evolution of a fluid pressure plume across a 3D mesh.  The mesh is a structured grid contatining 13,600 discretized cells and data across 63 timesteps. 

Final project for Machine Learning (CS 6350) at the University of Utah.
